<h1>School project: Create system for Milkfactory using OOP</h1>

### = To run the project go to: src/controller/GUI/main.java 

### = Need to install JavaFX to run the program 

I have decided to create system for Milkfactory where: 
- all employees can log in, see earned money, change their availability
- clients can log in and make orders for products
- administrator of milkfactory can remove/add employees from system, order ingredients for products creation, add/remove clients of the milkfactory.


 
In project I have used: 
- aggregation
- encapsulation
- singleton
- static attribute
- polymorphism
- overrriding
- interfaces
- GUI using JavaFX
- and more...
