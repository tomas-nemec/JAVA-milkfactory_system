<h1>School project: Create system for Milkfactory using OOP</h1>
I have decided to create system for Milkfactory, where all employees can log in, clients and also leader/administrator of milkfactory.
 
In project I have used: aggregation, encapsulation, singleton, static attribute, polymorphism, overrriding, interfaces, GUI using JavaFX.
